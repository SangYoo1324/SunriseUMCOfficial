          At Sunrise Christ Community Church Community Church our mission is to share God’s Shining Light. That Light is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who said, “I am the Light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life (John 8:12).” When we come to faith in Jesus we are no longer slaves to sin but are now clothed in his righteousness. “So, if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed (John 8:36).”

              Sunrise Christ CC is a Global Methodist Church, a traditional Wesleyan denomination that adheres to the historical orthodox tenants of Christianity. Methodism was formed in 18th century England when an ordained Anglican priest named John Wesley wished to reform the church in his native country. This calling was birthed when Wesley had a heartfelt experience through the Holy Spirit in which Jesus was revealed to him personally (see John 3:3-8) at a place called Aldersgate in London on May 24, 1738. Up until this time, though a trained theologian and pastor from Oxford, he had struggled with his faith being genuine. While listening to an open air exposition on the book of Romans at Aldersgate something “clicked” within his spirit and Christ became very real to him. Of this moment he later wrote “I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sin sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.” From here a movement began in which many a soul was changed forever through the saving work of Christ in their lives.

          Please know that at Sunrise Christ CC the doors are always open for all. Join us after Sunday worship for coffee, tea and light refreshments. Also, come share with us in Holy Communion the first Sunday of each month; together in remembrance of being redeemed from our sins through Christ finished work on the cross (John 19:30; Ephesians 1:7). Here at Sunrise we proclaim, as Peter did to Jesus question, “Who do you say I am”; replying with him, “You are the Messiah (Christ), the Son of the Living God (Matthew 16:16).” Follow us in our vision that God will bring to His church His sons and daughters from the east, west, north and south (Isaiah 43:5-7).
